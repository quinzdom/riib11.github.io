_Note_. These proofs use the
_[law of the excluded middle](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/excluded+middle)_
(and _double-negation elimination_, which is equivalent to the law of the
excluded middle)
[[nCatLab: Classical Logic](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/classical+logic)].

**Theorem**. God cannot create contradictions.

_Proof_. By the law of the excluded middle, either God can create contradictions
or He cannot. First, suppose that God can create contradictions. Then by the
principle of explosion, it follows that God cannot creature contradictions.
Second, suppose that God cannot create contradictions. Then the result follows
immediately. Since the result follows from both cases, the result is true.

**Corrolary**. God cannot create a rock He cannot lift.

_Proof_. Suppose that God _can_ create a rock He cannot lift. God is omnipotent
(by definition), which implies that he is able to lift any rock. This is a
contradiction, and by the previous theorem God cannot create contradictions, so
the supposition must be false. The result follows by double-negation
elimination.

**Corrolary**. God cannot keep all of His promises while also breaking one of
his promises.

_Proof_. Suppose that God _can_ keep all of His promises while also breaking one
of his promises. This creates a contradiction, and by the previous theorem God
cannot create contradictions, so the supposition must be false. The result
follows by double-negation elimination.
