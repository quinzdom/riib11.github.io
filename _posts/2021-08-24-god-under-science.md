Two years ago, I described a view I was developing that science is grounded in
an implicit monotheism in this Metagnosis episode:
[On God: Science and Modernity](https://metagnosis.simplecast.com/episodes/on-god-science-modernity).
This essay serves as a short exposition of a more developed version of this
view: Monotheistic Foundation for the Epistemology of Science.

## Two Axioms

The basis for the epistemology of science can be formulated as having two
axioms:

- The axiom of an _universal objectivity_: the universe (everything that can be
  observed) is objective
- The axiom of _natural induction_: _natural_ patterns in some observations is
  some evidence that those patterns also hold in other observations. (The
  predicate “natural” here is left as a definition that must be accounted for my
  particular accounts of natural induction.)

Note that the applicability of _Bayesian reasoning_ (and probabilistic reasoning
in general) requires universal objectivity since Bayesian reasoning relies on
the fact that each observation is made in the same universe even if the
observations happen at different times, places, and observers.

The axiom of natural induction is required for any reasoning beyond the purely
deductive (i.e. logic and, arguably, mathematics), and the _natural_ restriction
ensures that not all possible inductions are considered valid (i.e. natural).
The question of which particular inductions are natural is specified by a
particular account of natural induction, which is justified as an empirical
question about how natural induction is actually used (i.e. “natural induction”
definitionally refers to whatever we are using when we agree with some inductive
arguments and disagree with others).

These two axioms are in fact axioms because they are assumed in the epistemology
of science and are not derivable.

- Universal objectivity is not derivable since, without it, it is consistent to
  assume that universal subjectivity is false.
- The axiom of natural induction is not derivable since it makes no deductive
  claims. Natural induction is commonly “derived” by appealing to itself (i.e.
  “natural induction is true because it’s made true predictions in the past”),
  but circular arguments are inconsistent.

## God

Universal objectivity implies that there is exactly one universe, as the
universe is everything that can be observed and all observers observe the same
universe.

In the universe, natural induction implies that there are derivable patterns
(via induction) that have no derivable patterns (since they appeal to only
induction). (1) This arises from the fact that there must be finitely many
downward levels of explanation in any explanation hierarchy. (2) Patterns in the
_base_ (lowest level) of an explanation hierarchy only appeal to induction. Note
that the choice of hierarchies here is irrelevant as long as the choice is
consistent. Typically scientists tend to use a roughly standardized hierarchy of
explanations, for example in order from higher-to-lower level:

Biology > Chemistry > Physics

Biological patterns are explained in terms of biological or physical patterns.
Physical patterns are explained in terms of physical but never biological
patterns.

All this goes to show that the epistemology of science postulates a single
objective universe in which basic and unquestionable patterns (which we may be
unable to access the truth of) that ultimately account for everything that we
observe.

A simple way of describing this set of beliefs is that the epistemology of
science postulates some inaccessible source that accounts for why there are the
basic patterns in the universe that there are, and that these can be inductively
built upon to form higher levels of explanation.

TODO: Make the end of this section more clear and better argued. Right now it is
not well logically-connected

Note that this inaccessible source that accounts for the instantiation of
induction is not a part of the universe, as it cannot be observed definitionally
(otherwise induction would not need to be an axiom).

So, this source is outside of the universe, and is all powerful in that it
accounts for the basic patterns that ultimately account for all patterns. I call
this source God.

This God may not have many of the aspects of the God of many religions, but in
common with those ideas this idea of God does maintain that God is omnipotent
(God accounts for the basis of all patterns i.e. everything that happens), and
God is omniscient (In account for all patterns, God interacts with them). I do
not attempt to take a stance here on the omnibenevolence of this God.

If you don’t want to call this source God, that’s fine. But I think God is a
fitting name for such an extra-universal entity that controls everything.

## Proofs

Proof of (1). Cyclical hierarchies of explanations are inconsistent because an
explanation cannot be in terms of itself. Hierarchies of explanations that,
given a particular level, have an infinite depth are viscous regresses because
some explanations at this level can only be accounted for after infinitely many
steps. So, the only kind of hierarchy of explanations left is of finite
hierarchies.

Proof of (2). Induction is required to establish non-deductive facts and there
are no lower layers to appeal to in the explanation, and induction is an axiom
and so as an explanation for these patterns it is not derivable.
